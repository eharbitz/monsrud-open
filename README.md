### Welcome to Monsrud Open's repository

The `master` branch is automatically deployed to https://monsrud-open.herokuapp.com/ and 
the `dev` branch is automatically deployed to https://monsrud-open-dev.herokuapp.com/.


Create as many branches as you want and feel free to experiment in the `dev` branch. If we break the `dev` branch
we simply just resets it to the `master` branch.
 
 
In order to add a commit to the `master` branch you have to create a pull request from the branch you have.
The `master` branch is protected so that direct pushes are not allowed.

The domain http://www.monsrudopen.com/ should point to https://monsrud-open.herokuapp.com/.


#####Workflow:

1. Create a local branch by branching out of the master branch. Starting the branch name with `f-` for feature, `b-` for bugfix or `u-` for update is a great idea.
2. Merge into dev, push code and test your code on https://monsrud-open-dev.herokuapp.com/
3. Create a pull request from your branch into master. When it is approved and merged into master it will automatically be built and deployed to the production environment.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm start`

Sets up a static server and serves it. Running `npm run build` followed by `npm start`is an alternative to `npm run dev`.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
